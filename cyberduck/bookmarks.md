### Bookmark Options

| Setting | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Protocol | Your hosting service provider will let you know what protocol to use. Change the [protocol](connection.md#supported-protocols) in the<br/>topmost popup menu. |
| Nickname | Any name for the bookmark describing it for easy access using the bookmark filter. You can<br/>also type this name in the bookmark view to select it by name. |
| Server | The hostname of the server. This is not editable if you have chosen a protocol with a predefined,<br/>non-configurable hostname. *Make sure no server path is included but only the domain name and instead set any server path in _Path_.* |
| Username | The login credentials from your service provider. |
| SSH Private<br/>Key | For [SFTP](../protocols/sftp/index.md) connections only. Choose a private key for public key authentication instead of a<br/>password. If the key is password-protected, you are prompted to enter the passphrase to<br/>decrypt the key. |
| Client<br/>Certificate | For [HTTPS](../protocols/webdav/index.md#mutual-tls-mtls) connections only. Choose a client certificate for mutual transport level security (TLS). |
| Path | The initial working directory when connecting to the server. This must be the document root of<br/>the webserver if you want to configure HTTP URLs ([see below](#http-url)) to work. |
| Download<br/>Folder | Default location for files downloaded from this server. |
| Transfer<br/>Files | Choose to open a new connection for transfers in the [transfers](transfer.md#connections) window or to use the existing<br/>browser connection. When using the browser connection, transfers block other operations. |
| Connect<br/>Mode | For [FTP](../protocols/ftp.md) connections only. Refer to [FTP Connect Mode](../protocols/ftp.md#ftp-connect-mode). |
| Encoding | For [FTP](../protocols/ftp.md) connections only. Character encoding of filenames on the server. You can also change<br/>the encoding used when the connection is open using *View → Text Encoding* if characters<br/>are not displayed properly. Try `UTF-8` (the default), `ISO-8859-1`, and `Windows-1252`.<br/>Refer to [Character Encoding](../protocols/ftp.md#character-encoding). |
| Timezone | For all protocols except [FTP](../protocols/ftp.md), timestamps are reported in [UTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) from the server and there is no<br/>need for configuration. All timestamps in the browser are automatically converted to the timezone<br/>you have configured in the *System Preferences* and displayed in local time. For [FTP](../protocols/ftp.md)<br/>however, the local timezone is assumed for timestamps in directory listings If the server<br/>is configured with a different timezone that your Mac and returning the local time for<br/>modification dates, there will be an offset by the timezone difference. To get the correct local<br/>time for modification dates in the browser, you can choose the timezone of the server in the<br/>bookmark settings. Select *Bookmark → Edit Bookmark*. |

### Passwords

`````{tabs}
````{group-tab} macOS

Manage your passwords with *Keychain Access.app*. Refer to [Keychain for Mac: Kexchain Access overview](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH20093?locale=en_US).

````
````{group-tab} Windows

Passwords are saved in the *Credential Manager*. You can view and delete your saved login information in *Control Panel → User Accounts → Credential Manager → Windows Credentials*.

````
`````

## HTTP URL

With a valid configuration, you can open the corresponding HTTP URL of a file selected with your default web browser or copy the URL to the clipboard. You can select multiple files in the browser for a list of URLs.

Enter the HTTP URL of the web server using a different hostname than what you connect to using FTP. You also have to specify a reasonable default path in your bookmark (e.g. `/home/dkocher/public_html/`). That must be the directory accessed by the web server as your document root. Using an Apache web server this is equivalent to the `DocumentRoot` directive.

Example configuration:

| Server | sudo.ch | *Hostname configured in bookmark to<br/>connect to* |
| :--- | --- | ---: |
| Bookmark<br/>Path | `/usr/home/dkocher/public_html/` | *The Web Server Document Root* |
| Selected File | `/home/dkocher/public_html/stylsheet.css` | *A file selected in the browser* |
| HTTP URL | [http://sudo.ch/stylesheet.css](http://sudo.ch/stylesheet.css) | *Accessible in the web browser* |

```{image} _images/HTTP_URL.png

```

See also [Open or copy HTTP URL](browser.md#open-or-copy-http-url).

## Exporting Bookmarks

Drag the bookmark from the Bookmark Drawer anywhere to the *Finder.app/ Explorer* (e.g. the Desktop). You can double-click the document in the file browser to open a new connection to the server specified in the bookmark. To back up all bookmarks, refer to [this FAQ entry](faq.md#preferences-and-application-support-files-location).

```{image} _images/Drag_Bookmark.png

```

```{note}
You can share bookmarks between Mac & Windows as the file format is the same on both platforms.
```

## Sharing Bookmarks between Different Computers

You can share bookmarks between different computers and users by uploading the *Bookmarks* and *Profiles* folder to a Cloud Storage of your liking and creating a symbolic link to it.

```{warning}
This only works properly while using the standalone version of Cyberduck or Mountain Duck. The App Store version is unable to list the existing bookmarks from the symbolic link. 
```

**Step by step instructions using Dropbox as an example:**</br>
`````{tabs}
````{group-tab} macOS

1. Install the Dropbox app, log into your Dropbox account and synchronize the folder where you want to have the bookmarks to the local disk.
2. Quit *Cyberduck* and/or *Mountain Duck*.
3. Navigate to `~/Library/Group Containers/G69SCX94XU.duck/Library/Application Support/duck/` and move the folders *Bookmarks* and if available *Profiles* to the desired location on Dropbox.
4. Open *Terminal.app* and execute the command `ln -s <CloudDirectory> <AppSupportDirectory/foldername>` to create the symbolic link.
e.g.: `ln -s ~/Dropbox/Bookmarks ~/Library/Group Containers/G69SCX94XU.duck/Library/Application\Support/duck/Bookmarks`

````
````{group-tab} Windows

1. Install the Dropbox app, log into your Dropbox account and synchronize the folder where you want to have the bookmarks to the local disk.
2. Quit *Cyberduck* and/or *Mountain Duck*.
3. Navigate to `%AppData%\Cyberduck` and move the folders *Bookmarks* and if available *Profiles* to the desired location on Dropbox.
4. Use one of the options below to create the symbolic link:
	- Open *CMD* and execute the command `mklink /J <AppSupportDirectory\foldername> <CloudDirectory>`.
	- Open *PowerShell* and execute the command `New-Item -Type Junction -Target <CloudDirectory> -Path <AppSupportDirectory\foldername>`
